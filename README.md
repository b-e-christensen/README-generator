# README Generator &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)   
   
  This application takes a lot of the grunt work out of making a README. Using Node.js it asks you for several inputs (title, description, installation method, how to contribute, test instructions, section for fielding questions, and licensing) and uses that information to populate a README template. The structure is based off of what are considered to be some of the more professional README's out there. All it requires of you is to have a great understanding of your application.

  # Contributing  
    
  Have at it! I don't have any future plans with this project (as of now). I don't imagine there is much to be added onto it, as it is quite a simple application, but if you can think of anything to improve it have a go with it.
